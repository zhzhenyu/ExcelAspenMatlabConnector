The ASPEN simulation, Excel connector, and MATLAB are tested and ready to use. 

Before the successful implementation, the user should do the steps as follows:
1, specify the Excel connector path in the "subroutine" tab of the CMR USER2 module in the ASPEN simulation
2, add MATLAB-Excel add-ins in Excel
3, start MATLAB from the Excel connector. 
4, navigate to this folder path in Matlab and open the usermodel.m method
